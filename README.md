# JobTest01
For a job application

Used Visual Studio 2019 for this task and it should work regardless of where you put it on your computer. The program should be able to handle multiple barcode input if they are organized as the example file and documentation suggested. Hope it is sufficient, i was a bit busy this weekend so i only had half of sunday and monday to sit with this.
(Optional) If you want to check that the output file is not present in the JobTest01/WinDevTaskA prior to running the executable be my guest.

Just download all the files and the navigate to DevTask/DevTask/Bin/Release/netcoreapp3.1 and double click the executable called DevTask.exe and then you will find a new file called outputdata.txt with the desired output in the parent folder called JobTest01 under the other directory named WinDevTaskA. 

If there is anything you need to ask or for me to clarify you need only contact me!
